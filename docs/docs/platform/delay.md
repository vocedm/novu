# Delay Actions

The delay action awaits a specified amount of time before moving on to trigger the following steps of the workflow.

## Delay Node

After adding a delay node in the workflow editor, the immediate next step will only be triggered after the specified period of time has elapsed.

### Node configurations

### Regular Delay

Regular Delay will determine how long it will take before triggering the next step.

#### Time Interval

You can specify the amount and time unit that best suits your needs.

Should you wish to, you could override the default delay time interval you set in the creation of the delay node.

```typescript
novu.trigger('template-name', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '123',
  },
  payload: {
    name: 'Hello',
  },
  overrides: {
    delay: {
      unit: 'days',
      amount: 2,
    },
  },
});
```

### Scheduled Delay

Scheduled Delay allows delaying up to a future date before continuation of steps execution. All steps after delay node will be triggered only after said date.

#### Payload Path

Payload path will determine the path in payload for the scheduled date.

That path must be included in your payload on trigger execution and must be a date in strict ISO format.

For example:

![Workflow Photo](/img/scheduled-delay.png)

```typescript
novu.trigger('workflow-name', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '123',
  },
  payload: {
    sendAt: '2022-09-21T10:48:44.388Z',
  },
});
```

:::info

Date must be in ISO date format of YYYY-MM-DD**T**hh:mm:ss.SSS**Z**
